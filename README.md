### Online Service Management System

The Service Management System, built with PHP and MySQL, is a straightforward web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for its development. This system facilitates the addition of clients, services, technicians, and the generation of reports. Its simplicity and user-friendliness make it easy to grasp. Administrators have access to a dedicated admin panel for comprehensive data management, while clients can independently register, complete service forms tailored to their needs, and enjoy a seamless service delivery experience, all aimed at delivering the best possible service to clients.
